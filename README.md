1. Abstract: The dataset collects data from a wearable accelerometer mounted on the chest. Uncalibrated Accelerometer Data are collected from 15 participants performing 7 activities. The dataset is intended for Activity Recognition research purposes. It provides challenges for identification and authentication of people using motion patterns.

2. Relevant Information:
   --- The dataset collects data from a wearable accelerometer mounted on the chest
   --- Sampling frequency of the accelerometer: 52 Hz
   --- Accelerometer Data are Uncalibrated
   --- Number of Participants: 15
   --- Number of Activities: 7
   --- Data Format: CSV

3. Dataset Information
   --- Data are separated by participant
   --- Each file contains the following information
       ---- sequential number, x acceleration, y acceleration, z acceleration, label 
   --- Labels are codified by numbers
       --- 1: Working at Computer
       --- 2: Standing Up, Walking and Going up\down stairs
       --- 3: Standing
       --- 4: Walking
       --- 5: Going Up\Down Stairs
       --- 6: Walking and Talking with Someone
       --- 7: Talking while Standing
